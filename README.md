## Project Description:
**Interplanetary Fonts** is a decentralized Font marketplace that allows creators to collaborate on projects and be retributed in real-time for their work while providing a flexible way for users to buy and use fonts according to their needs.
<br><br>

## How it's made
The project is built on Polygon and uses Worldcoin + Lens to create a user friendly marketplace platform. Superfluid is used for the payment part, and artifacts (fonts and typeface) are hosted on IPFS.
